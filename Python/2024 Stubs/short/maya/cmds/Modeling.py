    r"""
    Defines the attachment of a metadata structure to one or more selected
    objects. This creates a placeholder with an empty metadata Stream for
    later population through the editMetadata command. It's similar
    in concept to the addAttr command for nodes - a data description
    is added but no data is actually set.
    
    
    When assigning a metadata structure you must specify these flags
    - channelName is the metadata channel type (e.g. "vertex"),
    streamName is the name of the metadata stream to be created,
    and structure is the name of the structure type defining the
    contents of the metadata. The indexType flag is optional.
    If it is not present then the index will be presumed to be a standard
    numerical value.
    
    
    You can query metadata information at a variety of levels. See the
    table below for a full list of the queryable arguments. In each case
    the specification of any of the non-queried arguments filters the list
    of metadata to be examined during the query. For all queries a single
    object must be selected for querying.
    
    
    For example querying the channelName flag with no other
    arguments will return the list of all Channel types on the selected
    object that contain any metadata. Querying the channelName flag
    with the indexType flag specified will return only those
    channel types containing metadata streams that use that particular
    type of index.
    
    
    Query the channelName flag to return the list of any channel types
    that have metadata.
    Specify the channelName and streamName flags and query the
    structure flag to return the name of the structure assigned to the
    given stream (if any).
    Specify a channelName and query the streamName to return
    the list of all streams assigned to that particular channel type.
    If you query the streamName without a specific channelName
    then it returns a list of pairs of (channelName, streamName) for all metadata
    streams.

    The curve align command is used to align curves in maya. The main
    alignment options are positional, tangent and curvature continuity.
    Curvature continuity implies tangent continuity.
    
    Positional continuity means the curves (move) or the ends of the
    curves (modify) are changed.
    
    Tangent continuity means one of the curves is modified to be tangent
    at the points where they meet.
    
    Curvature continuity means one of the curves is modified to be
    curvature continuous as well as tangent.
    
    The default behaviour, when no curves or flags are passed, is to only
    do positional and tangent continuity on the active list with the end
    of the first curve and the start of the other curve used for alignment.

        jnp: (create, edit, query) - Parameter on reference curve where modified curve is to be aligned to. Default: 123456.0
        nds: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

    Define the values of a particular set of metadata on selected objects.
    This command is used in preservation of metadata through Maya file formats

    will cease to exist.)

    the addMetadata command or API equivalent to attach a metadata

    This command returns the arclength of a curve if the history
    flag is not set (the default).  If the history flag is set, a node
    is created that can produce the arclength, and is connected and
    its name returned.  Having the construction history option on
    makes this command useful for expressions.

The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

    Takes in a description of the structure and creates it, adding it to
    the list of available data structures. The structure definition can
    either be supplied in the asString flag or exist in a file that is
    referenced by the asFile flag.
    
    
    If the remove flag is specified with a name flag then the data
    structure will be removed. This is to keep all structure operations
    in a single command rather than create separate commands to create,
    remove, and query the data structures. When you use the removeAll
    flag then every existing metadata structure is removed. Use with care!
    Note that removed structures may still be in use in metadata Streams after
    removal, they are just no longer available for the creation of new Streams.
    
    
    Both the creation modes and the remove mode are undoable.
    
    
    Creation of an exact duplicate of an existing structure (including name)
    will succeed silently without actually creating a new structure.
    Attempting to create a new non-duplicate structure with the same name
    as an existing structure will fail as there is no way to disambiguate
    two structures with the same name.
    
    
    Querying modes are defined to show information both on the created
    structures and the structure serialization formats that have been
    registered. The serialization formats preserve the structure
    information as text (e.g. raw, XML, JSON). Since the raw structure
    type is built in it will be assumed when none are specified.
    
    
    General query with no flags will return the list of names of all
    currently existing structures.
    
    
    Querying the format flag will return the list of all registered structure
    serialization formats.
    
    
    Querying with the format supplied before the query flag will
    show the detailed description of that particular structure
    serialization format.
    
    
    Querying the asString flag with a structure name and serialization
    format supplied before the query flag will return a string
    representing the named data structure in the serialization format
    specified by the format flag. Even if the format is the same as
    the one that created the structure the query return string may not
    be identical since the queried value is formatted in a standard
    way - original formatting is not preserved.
    
    
    Querying the asFile flag with a structure name supplied before the
    query flag will return the original file from which the structure
    was generated. If the structure was created using the asString
    flag or through the API then an empty string will be returned.
    
    
    Querying the name flag returns the list of all structures created
    so far.

    Args:
        af: (create, query) - Specify a file that contains the serialized data which describes the structure.  The format of the data is specified by the 'format' flag.
        asString: (create, query) - Specify the string containing the serialized data which describes the structure. The format of the data is specified by the 'format' flag.
        dt: (create, query) - Used with the flag 'listMemberNames' to query the type of the member. The type is appended after each relative member in the array. For example, if the format is "name=idStructure:int32=id:string=name" the returned array is "id int32 name string".
        fmt: (create, query) - Format of data to expect in the structure description. "raw" is supported natively and will be assumed if the format type is omitted. Others are available via plug-in. You can query the available formats by using this flag in query mode. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        lmn: (create, query) - Query the member names in the dataStructure. The member names will be returned in an array. The name of the data structure will not be returned. To get the type of each member, use 'dataType' together. Then the type of the member will be appended in the array after their relative member. For example, if the format is "name=idStructure:int32=id:string=name" the returned array is "id int32 name string".
        n: (query) - Query mode only.  Name of the data structure to be queried, or set to list the available names. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        rem: (create) - Remove the named data structure. It's an error if it doesn't exist.

        nds: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

    r"""
    This command is used to set metadata elements onto or remove metadata
    elements from an object. Before using this command you must first attach
    a metadata stream type to the object using the addMetadata command
    or an API equivalent. The command has four basic variations:
    
    Set per-component metadata on meshes
    Remove per-component metadata on meshes
    Set generic metadata on any object
    Remove generic metadata on any object
    
    
    The difference between the set and remove variations
    (1,3 vs. 2,4) is that set requires both a member name to be set
    and a new value to be set. (The reason removal doesn't use a member
    name is that you can only remove an entire metadata structural element,
    you cannot remove only a single member from it.)
    
    
    When metadata values are set or removed the action is performed on
    every selected component or index. This provides an easy method to
    set or remove a bunch of metadata en masse.
    
    
    The general usage (variations 3, 4) lets you select specific pieces
    of metadata through the channelName and index
    flags. Note that since index is a multi-use flag you
    can select many different elements from the same Channel and set or
    remove the metadata on all of them in one command.
    
    
    Metadata on meshes is special in that the Channel types "vertex",
    "edge", "face", and "vertexFace" are directly connected to the
    components of the same name. To make setting these metadata
    Channels easier you can simply select or specify on the command
    line the corresponding components rather than using the channelName
    and index flags. For example the selection "myMesh.vtx[8:10]"
    corresponds to channelName = vertex and index = 8, 9, 10
    (as a multi-use flag).
    
    
    Note that the metadata is assigned to an object and except in the special
    case of mesh geometry does not flow through the dependency graph. In
    meshes the metadata will move from node to node wherever the geometry
    is connected, although it will not adjust itself automatically for changes
    in topology. Internal data is arranged to minimize the amount of copying
    no matter how many other nodes are connected to it.
    
    
    Only a single node or scene, component type, channel type, and value type
    are allowed in a single command. This keeps the data simple at the possible
    cost of requiring multiple calls to the command to set more than one
    structure member's value.
    
    
    Certain nodes have metadata supplied by input attributes. If you edit one
    of those with an incoming connection on such an attribute then the metadata
    edit will not be applied directly it will be put into an 'editMetadata' node
    for application during DG evaluation. Since the details of the metadata are
    not known until the evaluation happens less rigorous compatibility checking
    is performed. The editMetadata node has its own facilities for verifying and
    reporting illegal metadata edits. Successive edits to the same metadata in
    this way appends each edit to the same editMetadata node.

    Args:
        mn: (create) - Name of the Structure member being edited. The names of the members are set up in the Structure definition, either through the description passed in through the "dataStructure" command or via the API used to create that Structure.
        rem: (create) - If the remove flag is set then the metadata will be removed rather than have values set. In this mode the "memberName", "value", and "stringValue" flags are ignored. "memberName" is ignored because when deleting metadata all members of a structure must be removed as a group. The others are ignored since when deleting you don't need a value to be set.
        sv: (create, multiuse) - String value to be set into the specified metadata locations. This flag can only be used when the data member is a numeric type. If the member has N dimensions (e.g. string[2]) then this flag must appear N times (e.g. 2 times) The same values are applied to the specified metadata member on all affected components or metadata indices. Only one of the value, and stringValue flags can be specified at once and the type must match the type of the structure member named by the "member" flag.
        v: (create, multiuse) - Numeric value to be set into the specified metadata locations. This flag can only be used when the data member is a numeric type. If the member has N dimensions (e.g. float[3]) then this flag must appear N times (e.g. 3 times) The same values are applied to the specified metadata member on all affected components or metadata indices. All numeric member types should use this type of value specification, i.e. everything except string and matrix types. Only one of the value, and stringValue flags can be specified at once and the type must match the type of the structure member named by the "member" flag.
        cn: (create, query) - Filter the metadata selection to only recognize metadata belonging to the specified named Channel (e.g. "vertex"). This flag is ignored if the components on the selection list are being used to specify the metadata of interest. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        cht: (create, query) - Obsolete - use the 'channelName' flag instead. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        eix: (create) - The metadata is stored in a Stream, which is an indexed list. If you have mesh components selected then the metadata indices are implicit in the list of selected components. If you select only the node or scene then this flag may be used in conjunction with the startIndex flag to specify a range of indices from which to retrieve the metadata. It is an error to have the value of startIndex be greater than that of endIndex.   See also the index flag for an alternate way to specify multiple indices. This flag can only be used on index types that support a range (e.g. integer values - it makes no sense to request a range between two strings)  			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        idx: (create, multiuse, query) - In the typical case metadata is indexed using a simple integer value. Certain types of data may use other index types. e.g. a "vertexFace" component will use a "pair" index type, which is two integer values; one for the face ID of the component and the second for the vertex ID.   The index flag takes a string, formatted in the way the specified indexType requires. All uses of the index flag have the same indexType. If the type was not specified it is assumed to be a simple integer value.  			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        idt: (create, query) - Name of the index type the new Channel should be using. If not specified this defaults to a simple integer index. Of the native types only a mesh "vertexFace" channel is different, using a "pair" index type. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        scn: (create, query) - Use this flag when you want to add metadata to the scene as a whole rather than to any individual nodes. If you use this flag and have nodes selected the nodes will be ignored and a warning will be displayed.
        six: (create) - The metadata is stored in a Stream, which is an indexed list. If you have mesh components selected then the metadata indices are implicit in the list of selected components. If you select only the node or scene then this flag may be used in conjunction with the endIndex flag to specify a range of indices from which to retrieve the metadata. It is an error to have the value of startIndex be greater than that of endIndex.   See also the index flag for an alternate way to specify multiple indices. This flag can only be used on index types that support a range (e.g. integer values - it makes no sense to request a range between two strings)  			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        stn: (create, query) - Name of the metadata Stream. Depending on context it could be the name of a Stream to be created, or the name of the Stream to pass through the filter. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.

    The curve fillet command creates a fillet curve between two curves.
    If no objects are specified in the command line, then the first two
    active curves are used. The fillet created can be circular (with
    a radius) or freeform (with a type of tangent or blend).

    Args:
        b: (create, edit, query) - Adjusting the bias value causes the fillet curve to be skewed to one of the input curves. Available only if blendControl is true. Default: 0.0

        cir: (create, edit, query) - Curve fillet will be created as circular if true or freeform if false. Default: true
        cp1: (create, edit, query) - Parameter where fillet curve will contact the primary input curve. Default: 0.0
        cp2: (create, edit, query) - Parameter where fillet curve will contact the secondary input curve. Default: 0.0
        d: (create, edit, query) - Adjusts the depth of the fillet curve. Available only if blendControl is true. Default: 0.5
        fb: (create, edit, query) - The freeform type is blend if true or tangent if false. Available if the fillet type is freeform. Default: false
        nds: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.     Default: kdnNormal
        r: (create, edit, query) - The radius if creating a circular fillet. Default: 1.0
        ch: (create) - Turn the construction history on or off.
        jn: (create) - Should the fillet be joined?
        n: (create) - Sets the name of the newly-created node. If it contains namespace path, the new node will be created under the specified namespace; if the namespace does not exist, it will be created.

    r"""
    This command is used to retrieve the values of metadata elements from a node or scene.
    It is restricted to returning a single structure member at a time. For convenience
    the detail required is only enough to find a single Member of a single Structure
    on a single metadata Channel.
    
    
    In the simplest case if there is a single Stream on one metadata Channel
    which uses a Structure with only one Member then all that is required is the
    name of the object containing the metadata. In the most complex case the
    'channelName', 'streamName', and 'memberName' are all required to narrow down
    the metadata to a single unique Member.
    
    
    In general for scripting it's a good idea to use all flags anyway since there
    could be metadata added anywhere. The shortcuts are mainly for quick entry when
    entering commands directly in the script editor or command line.
    
    
    When an Index is specified where data is not present the command fails with a
    message telling you which Index or Indices didn't have values. Use the
    hasMetadata command first to determine where metadata exists if you
    need to know in advance where to find valid metadata.
    
    Filter Flags
    channelName - Only look for metadata on one particular Channel type
    streamName - Only look for metadata on one particular named Stream. When
    used in conjunction with channelName then ignore Streams with a matching
    name but a different Channel type
    index - Only look for metadata on one or more specific Index values of
    a Stream. Requires use of the streamName flag. Does not require the
    indexType flag as that will be inferred by the streamName.
    startIndex/endIndex - Same as index but using an entire range of
    Index values rather than a single one. Not valid for index types not supporting
    ranges (e.g. strings)
    indexType - Only look for metadata using a particular Index type. Can
    have its scope narrowed by other filter flags as well.
    memberName - The particular Member in the metadata in a Structure to
    retrieve. If this is not specified the Structure can only have a single Member.
    
    
    Metadata on meshes is special in that the Channel types "vertex",
    "edge", "face", and "vertexFace" are directly connected to the
    components of the same name. To make getting these metadata
    Channels easier you can simply select or specify on the command
    line the corresponding components rather than using the channelName
    and index/startIndex/endIndex flags. For
    example the selection "myMesh.vtx[8:10]" corresponds to
    channelName = vertex and either index = 8, 9, 10
    as a multi-use flag or setIndex = 8, endIndex=10.
    
    
    Only a single node or scene and unique metadata Structure Member are
    allowed in a single command. This keeps the data simple at the possible
    cost of requiring multiple calls to the command to get more than one
    Structure Member's value.
    
    
    When the data is returned it will be in Index order with an entire Member
    appearing together. For example if you were retrieving float[3] metadata on
    three components you would get the nine values back in the order:
    index[0]-float[0], index[0]-float[1], index[0]-float[2],
    index[1]-float[0], index[1]-float[1], index[1]-float[2],
    index[2]-float[0], index[2]-float[1], index[2]-float[2]. In the Python
    implementation the float[3] values will be an array each so you would
    get back three float[3] arrays.

    Args:
        dt: (create) - Used with the flag 'streamName' and 'memberName' to query the dataType of the specfied member.
        lcn: (create) - Query the channel names on the shape. This flag can be used with some flags to filter the results. It can be used with the flag 'streamName' to get the channel with the specfied stream and the flag 'memberName' to get the channel in which the stream contains the specified member. It cannot be used with the flag 'channelName'.
        lmn: (create) - Query the member names on the shape. This flag can be used with some flags to filter the results.

        mn: (create) - Name of the Structure member being retrieved. The names of the members are set up in the Structure definition, either through the description passed in through the "dataStructure" command or via the API used to create that Structure. This flag is only necessary when selected Structures have more than one member.
        cn: (create, query) - Filter the metadata selection to only recognize metadata belonging to the specified named Channel (e.g. "vertex"). This flag is ignored if the components on the selection list are being used to specify the metadata of interest. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        cht: (create, query) - Obsolete - use the 'channelName' flag instead. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        eix: (create) - The metadata is stored in a Stream, which is an indexed list. If you have mesh components selected then the metadata indices are implicit in the list of selected components. If you select only the node or scene then this flag may be used in conjunction with the startIndex flag to specify a range of indices from which to retrieve the metadata. It is an error to have the value of startIndex be greater than that of endIndex.   See also the index flag for an alternate way to specify multiple indices. This flag can only be used on index types that support a range (e.g. integer values - it makes no sense to request a range between two strings)  			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        idx: (create, multiuse, query) - In the typical case metadata is indexed using a simple integer value. Certain types of data may use other index types. e.g. a "vertexFace" component will use a "pair" index type, which is two integer values; one for the face ID of the component and the second for the vertex ID.   The index flag takes a string, formatted in the way the specified indexType requires. All uses of the index flag have the same indexType. If the type was not specified it is assumed to be a simple integer value.  			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        idt: (create, query) - Name of the index type the new Channel should be using. If not specified this defaults to a simple integer index. Of the native types only a mesh "vertexFace" channel is different, using a "pair" index type. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        scn: (create, query) - Use this flag when you want to add metadata to the scene as a whole rather than to any individual nodes. If you use this flag and have nodes selected the nodes will be ignored and a warning will be displayed.
        six: (create) - The metadata is stored in a Stream, which is an indexed list. If you have mesh components selected then the metadata indices are implicit in the list of selected components. If you select only the node or scene then this flag may be used in conjunction with the endIndex flag to specify a range of indices from which to retrieve the metadata. It is an error to have the value of startIndex be greater than that of endIndex.   See also the index flag for an alternate way to specify multiple indices. This flag can only be used on index types that support a range (e.g. integer values - it makes no sense to request a range between two strings)  			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.

As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.

    This command is used to query for the presence of metadata elements on a node,
    components, or scene. The command works at all levels of metadata presence, from
    the existence of any metadata at all on a node or scene right down to the presence
    of metadata values set on a particular metadata Stream index.
    
    Filter Flags
    channelName - Only look for metadata on one particular Channel type
    streamName - Only look for metadata on one particular named Stream. When
    used in conjunction with channelName then ignore Streams with a matching
    name but a different Channel type
    index - Only look for metadata on one or more specific Index values of
    a Stream. Requires use of the streamName flag. Does not require the
    indexType flag as that will be inferred by the streamName.
    startIndex/endIndex - Same as index but using an entire range of
    Index values rather than a single one
    indexType - Only look for metadata using a particular Index type. Can
    have its scope narrowed by other filter flags as well.
    ignoreDefault - Treat any metadata that still has the default value
    (e.g. 0 for numerics, "" for strings) the same as metadata that isn't present.
    This means that any metadata with default values will not be reported. It is
    useful for quickly finding values that you have changed. When this flag is
    set you can also use the memberName filter to narrow down the check to
    a particular member of the metadata Structure. Without that filter it will only
    skip over metadata where every member of the Structure has a non-default value.
    memberName - Only look at one particular Member in the metadata in a
    Structure. Only used when checking for non-default values as existence is based
    on the entire Structure, not any particular Member.
    
    Operation Flags
    normal mode - Return True for every specified location containing
    metadata. This combines with the filter flags as follows:
    no flag - True if there is any metadata at all on the node or scene
    channelName - True if there is any metadata at all on the Channel
            with the given name
    streamName - True if there is any metadata at all on the Stream
            with the given name
    index/startIndex/endIndex - An array of booleans ordered the same
            as the natural ordering of the Index values (i.e. specifying index 3, 2, and 4
            in that order will still return booleans in the order for indices 2,3,4)
            where True means that there is metadata assigned at that Index. This form is
            better suited with the asList modification since with that variation it
            is easier to tell exactly which indices have the metadata.
    
    
    asList - Adding this flag switches the return values from a single boolean
    or array of booleans to an array of strings indicating exactly which metadata elements
    have values. The return values of the command are changed to be the following:
    no flag - List of Channel names with metadata
    channelName - List of Stream names in the Channel with metadata
    streamName - List of Index values on the Stream with metadata
    index/startIndex/endIndex - List of Index values with metadata,
            restricted to the set of specified Index values.

    Args:
        al: (create) - Use this flag when you want to return string values indicating where the metadata lives rather than boolean values. See the command description for more details on what this flag will return.
        id: (create) - Use this flag when you want to skip over any metadata that has only default values. i.e. the metadata may exist but it hasn't had a new value set yet (non-zero for numerics, non-empty strings, etc.) See the command description for more details on how this flag filters the search.
        mn: (create) - Name of the Structure member being checked. The names of the members are set up in the Structure definition, either through the description passed in through the "dataStructure" command or via the API used to create that Structure. As the assignment of metadata is on a per-structure basis this flag only needs to be specified when querying for non-default values. If you query for non-default values and omit this flag then it checks that any of the members have a non-default value.
        cn: (create, query) - Filter the metadata selection to only recognize metadata belonging to the specified named Channel (e.g. "vertex"). This flag is ignored if the components on the selection list are being used to specify the metadata of interest. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        cht: (create, query) - Obsolete - use the 'channelName' flag instead. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        eix: (create) - The metadata is stored in a Stream, which is an indexed list. If you have mesh components selected then the metadata indices are implicit in the list of selected components. If you select only the node or scene then this flag may be used in conjunction with the startIndex flag to specify a range of indices from which to retrieve the metadata. It is an error to have the value of startIndex be greater than that of endIndex.   See also the index flag for an alternate way to specify multiple indices. This flag can only be used on index types that support a range (e.g. integer values - it makes no sense to request a range between two strings)  			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        idx: (create, multiuse, query) - In the typical case metadata is indexed using a simple integer value. Certain types of data may use other index types. e.g. a "vertexFace" component will use a "pair" index type, which is two integer values; one for the face ID of the component and the second for the vertex ID.   The index flag takes a string, formatted in the way the specified indexType requires. All uses of the index flag have the same indexType. If the type was not specified it is assumed to be a simple integer value.  			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.

        scn: (create, query) - Use this flag when you want to add metadata to the scene as a whole rather than to any individual nodes. If you use this flag and have nodes selected the nodes will be ignored and a warning will be displayed.

When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that.

Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy.

    The insertKnotSurface command inserts knots (aka isoparms) into a
    surface given a list of parameter values.  The number of knots
    to add at each parameter value
    and whether the knots are added or complemented can be specified.
    The name of the surface is returned and
    if history is on, the name of the resulting dependency node is
    also returned.
    
    You must specify one, none or all number of knots with the "-nk" flag.
    eg. if you specify none, then the default (one) knot will be added
    at each specified parameter value.  If you specify one "-nk" value
    then that number of knots will be added at each parameter value.
    Otherwise, you must specify the same number of "-nk" flags as "-p" flags,
    defining the number of knots to be added at each specified parameter value.
    
    You can insert up to "degree" knots at a
    parameter value that isn't already an isoparm.  eg. for a degree 3
    surface, you can insert up to 3 knots.
    
    Use this operation if you need more CVs in a local area of the surface.
    Use this operation if you want to create a corner in the surface.
    
    Note: A single insertKnotSurface command cannot insert in both directions
    at once; you must use two separate commands to do this.

    Args:
        add: (create, edit, query) - Whether to add knots or complement.  Complement means knots will be added to reach the specified number of knots. Default: true

    The cmd creates a railed surface by sweeping the profiles using two
    rail curves. The two rails are the last two arguments. For examples,
    if 5 curves are specified, they will correspond to "curve1" "curve2"
    "curve3" "rail1" "rail2".
    
    In this case, the cmd creates a railed surface by sweeping the profile
    "curve1" to profile "curve2", profile "curve2" to profile "curve3"
    along the two rail curves "rail1", "rail2". There must be atleast 3
    profile curves followed by the two rail curves. The profile curves
    must intersect the two rail curves. The constructed may be made
    tangent continuous to the first and last profile using the flags -tp1,
    -tp2 provided the profiles are surface curves i.e. isoparms, curve on
    surface or trimmed edge.

    Args:
        cch: (create, edit, query) - Toggle caching for all attributes so that no recomputation is needed
        nds: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

    The offset command creates new offset curves from the selected curves.

    circular (connect with an arc) or linear (connect linearly resulting
    in a sharp corner). If loop cutting is on then any loops in the
    offset curves are trimmed away. For the default cut radius of 0.0 a
    sharp corner is created at each intersection. For values greater than
    0.0 a small arc of that radius is created at each intersection.
    The cut radius value is only valid when loop cutting is on.

    number of times the offset object can be subdivided (i.e. calculate
    the offset until the offset comes within tolerance or the iteration
    reaches this maximum.)
    The reparameterize option allows the offset curve to have a different

    distributions in the offset curve that can occur with large offsets
    of curves, but is more expensive to compute.

The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

Note: If the object already has construction history then this flag is ignored and the node will always be inserted into the history chain.

        n: (create) - Give a name to the resulting node.
        nds: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

        nds: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.     Default: kdnNormal
        o: (create, edit, query) - The offset for bevel. Default: 0.2
        oaf: (create, edit, query) - If on, the offset value is treated as a fraction between zero and one. Default: false
        r: (create, edit, query) - The roundness of bevel, it is taken into account when autoFit is off. Default: 0.5

The default is merge by name.
        nds: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.     Default: kdnNormal

The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.

        ch: (create, query) - Turn the construction history on or off (where applicable). If construction history is on then the corresponding node will be inserted into the history chain for the mesh. If construction history is off then the operation will be performed directly on the object.  Note: If the object already has construction history then this flag is ignored and the node will always be inserted into the history chain.
        cm: (create, query) - This flag when set true will create a new map with a the name passed in, if the map does not already exist.
        ic: (create, edit, query) - The center point of the 2D model layout. Default: 0.5, 0.5
        icx: (create, edit, query) - Image center X coord.
        icy: (create, edit, query) - Image center Y coord.
        imageScale: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the UV scale : Enlarges or reduces the 2D version of the model in U or V space relative to the 2D centerpoint. Default: 1.0, 1.0
        isu: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the UV scale : Enlarges or reduces the 2D version of the model in U or V space relative to the 2D centerpoint.
        isv: (create, edit, query) - The V scale : Enlarges or reduces the 2D version of the model in V space relative to the 2D centerpoint.
        ibd: (create) - This flag specifies if the projection node should be inserted before or after deformer nodes already applied to the shape. Inserting the projection after the deformer leads to texture swimming during animation and is most often undesirable. C: Default is on.
        kir: (create) - True means keep any image ratio
        md: (create) - This flag specifies the mapping direction. 'x', 'y' and 'z' projects the map along the corresponding axis. 'c' projects along the current camera viewing direction. 'p' does perspective projection if current camera is perspective. 'b' projects along the best plane fitting the objects selected.
        n: (create) - Give a name to the resulting node.
        nds: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.     Default: kdnNormal
        pi: (create) - True if the new map is per-instance, otherwise it is shared.
        pc: (create, edit, query) - The origin point from which the map is projected. Default: 0.0, 0.0, 0.0
        pcx: (create, edit, query) - Projection center X coord.
        pcy: (create, edit, query) - Projection center Y coord.
        pcz: (create, edit, query) - Projection center Z coord.
        ph: (create, edit, query) - The height of the map relative to the 3D projection axis
        phs: (create, edit, query) - The angle swept by the 3D projection axis
        ps: (create, edit, query) - The width and the height of the map relative to the 3D projection axis. Default: 180.0, 1.0
        psu: (create, edit, query) - The width of the map relative to the 3D projection axis.
        psv: (create, edit, query) - The height of the map relative to the 3D projection axis.
        r: (create, edit, query) - Used by the UI : Manipulator. Default: 10.0
        ra: (create, edit, query) - The for the rotation. When the angle is positive, then the map rotates counterclockwise on the mapped model, whereas when it is negative then the map rotates lockwise on the mapped model. Default: 0.0
        sc: (create, edit, query) - Used to indicate fixing UV seams. Default: false
        sf: (create) - True means use the smart fit algorithm
        ws: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies which reference to use. If "on" : all geometrical values are taken in world reference. If "off" : all geometrical values are taken in object reference. C: Default is off. Q: When queried, this flag returns an int.

    Returns the required counts on the specified objects.
    If no objects are specified in the command line, then the
    objects from the active list are used.
    
    In MEL, the values are returned in the same order as the flags are set.
    Under Python, there is no concept of argument ordering, so the items are
    returned in a dictionary keyed by the name of the flag.  In Python, if only
    one item is requested, then it will not be returned in a dictionary.
    For user convenience, if no flag is set, then all values are echoed.
    
    All flags (except -fmt/format) are in fact query-flags. For
    user convenience, the -q flag may be ommitted.
    
    Some comments for non-formatted output :
    
    3d bounding boxes are returned as 3 couples of floats,
    2d ones as 2 couples of floats.
    
    if a bounding box is queried and cannot be computed (for example
    the component bounding box when no component is selected, or 2d bounding box for
    and unmapped object) 0 is returned for each array element, so that
    indices in the output array remain consistent.
    
    int values (queried by topological flags) cannot be
    mixed with float values (queried by bounding box flags).
    Thus if no flag is set, only int values are returned.

        nds: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

    This command performs a render sampling of surface color and transparency
    for each selected vertex or face and stores the sampled data
    as either the color value, or uses the sampled data to displace
    the affected vertices or faces by a sampled data value.
    Transparency is not used for displacement, and displacement
    is performed along vertex normals.
    The sampled data value used can be pre-scaled by a user defined
    amount.
    Additionally, the normals chosen for sampling can be overridden
    using a "flat" shading option. This option basically means
    to always use the normals of the faces when computing
    sampling values. This may be a desired if the user
    wishes to override an edge smoothness factor. Basically
    with the "flat" shading option on, edges are always
    considered to be hard.
    Note that displacement sampling will result
    in the -sampleByFace option to be turned
    off, since a displacement of a vertex
    always affects the faces the vertex
    is connected to.
    Finally, it is possible to force the storage of shared
    colors per vertex, and / or force the usage of unshared
    UV values.
    The computation of the resulting color is as follows:
    
            resulting-RGB = (sampled-RGB * scale-factor);
            if (color blend is none)
                    resulting-RGB = geometry-RGB
            else if (color blend is add)
                    resulting-RGB = geometry-RGB + sampled-RGB;
            else if (color blend is subtract)
                    resulting-RGB = geometry-RGB - sampled-RGB;
            else if (color blend is multiply)
                    resulting-RGB = geometry-RGB * sampled-RGB;
            else if (color blend is divide)
                    resulting-RGB = geometry-RGB / sampled-RGB;
            else if (color blend is average)
                    resulting-RGB = (geometry-RGB * 1/2) + (sampled-RGB * 1/2);
            if (clamp option set)
                    clamp resulting-RGB between minimum-RGB and maximum-RGB,
    
    The analogous computation is done for computing the resulting alpha
    value.
    The command requires that there be a camera selected in your scene in
    order to work properly in -batch or -prompt mode.

        abl: (create, edit) - When specified, indicates the type of alpha blend to be applied. Options are: "none", "overwrite", "add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide", "average".

        nds: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.

    Args:

        ch: (create, query) - Turn the construction history on or off (where applicable).

If construction history is off then the operation will be performed directly on the object.  Note: If the object already has construction history then this flag is ignored and the node will always be inserted into the history chain.
        gb: (create) - This allows the user to blend between a local optimization method (globalBlend = 0.0) and a global optimization method (globalBlend = 1.0). The local optimization method looks at the ratio between the triangles on the object and the triangles in UV space.  It has a side affect that it can sometimes introduce tapering problems.  The global optimization is much slower, but takes into consideration the entire object when optimizing uv placement.
        gmb: (create) - The global optimization method uses two functions to compute a minimization.  The first function controls edge stretch by using edges lengths between xyz and uv.  The second function penalizes the first function by preventing configurations where triangles would overlap.  For every surface there is a mix between these two functions that will give the appropriate response. Values closer to 1.0 give more weight to the edge length function. Values closer to 0.0 give more weight to surface area.  The default value of '0.5' is a even mix between these two values.
        i: (create) - Maximum number of iterations for each connected UV piece.
        n: (create) - Give a name to the resulting node.
        nds: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value.

When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that.

Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.

        ibd: (create) - Specifies if the projection node should be inserted         before or after deformer nodes already applied to the shape.         Inserting the projection after the deformer leads to texture         swimming during animation and is most often undesirable.         Default is on.

For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value.

When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.

    for backwards compatibility.  Therefore, we recommend setting the version flag
    to 1 for best results as the new algorithm is better at preserving geometry
    features.  Additionally, some flags only apply to a specific algorithm and
    this is documented for each flag.

        ch: (create, query) - Turn the construction history on or off (where applicable). If construction history is on then the corresponding node will be inserted into the history chain for the mesh.

The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

        p: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies how many vertices to remove during reduction as a percentage of the original mesh.  This flag only applies if the termination flag is set to 0 or when using the old algorithm. C: Default is 0. 100 will remove every possible vertex, 0 will remove none. Q: When queried, this flag returns a float.

        shp: (create, edit, query) - Sharpness controls the balance between preserving small, sharp details versus larger shapes.  At low values, details that are small relative to the general shape of the object are more likely to be collapsed.  At high values, they are more likely to be kept.

For each vertex of the mesh, we find its exact symmetric point, then we look for the closest vertex to the exact symmetry up to the tolerance distance.  Higher values risk finding more spurious symmetries, lower values might miss symmetries. The value is distance in object space.  This flag only applies when using the new algorithm (-version 1) and the useVirtualSymmetry flag is not set to 0. C: Default is 0. Q: When queried, this flag returns a float.

        uwt: (create, edit, query) - This flag only applies when using the old algorithm and is provided for backwards compatibility. How much consideration uv positions are given in the reduction algorithm. A higher weight means the reduction will try harder to preserve uv positions. C: Default is 0. Q: When queried, this flag returns a float.
        ver: (create, edit, query) - Version of the poly reduce algorithm to use. 0 Old algorithm used in Maya 2013 and prior for backwards compatibility 1 New algorithm derived from Softimage and used in Maya 2014 and later The default is 0 for backwards compatibility but for best results it is recommended that the new algorithm is used as it is better at preserving mesh details. Some flags only apply to a specific algorithm and this is documented for each flag. C: Default is 0 for backwards compatibility. Q: When queried, this flag returns an integer.
        vct: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies a target number of vertices to retain after reduction. Note that other factors such as quad and feature preservation may take precendence and cause the actual number of vertices to be different.

        vmp: (create, query) - Name of a color set to be added to the output mesh that stores a mapping from vertices in the output mesh to vertices in the input mesh.  The color set is RGB.  The original vertex Id that maps to an output vertex is of a vertex is 65536*r + g where r and g are the red and green channel at a vertex. The blue channel is always zero.  Each vertex in the output mesh has a shared color. This flag only applies when using the new algorithm. (-version 1) Q: When queried, this flag returns a string.
        vwc: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies a constant value to multiply to each weight map value. A value of zero turns off the weight map.  This flag only applies when using the new algorithm. (-version 1) C: Default is 1. Q: When queried, this flag returns a float.
        wc: (create, edit, query) - This flag only applies when using the old algorithm and is provided for backwards compatibility. The weight of each vertex is multiplied with this coefficient when the reduction is performed.  This value does not have to be edited, normally.  It gives finer control over the weighted reduction. This attribute is replaced by vertexWeightCoefficient in the new algorithm when the version flag is set to 1. C: Default is 10000. Q: When queried, this flag returns a float.

The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

    TpolyProjCmdBase is a base class for the command to create a mapping on the selected polygonal faces.
    Projects a spherical map onto an object.

    Args:
        cch: (create, edit, query) - Toggle caching for all attributes so that no recomputation is needed
        ch: (create, query) - Turn the construction history on or off (where applicable). If construction history is on then the corresponding node will be inserted into the history chain for the mesh. If construction history is off then the operation will be performed directly on the object.  Note: If the object already has construction history then this flag is ignored and the node will always be inserted into the history chain.
        cm: (create, query) - This flag when set true will create a new map with a the name passed in, if the map does not already exist.
        ibd: (create) - This flag specifies if the projection node should be inserted before or after deformer nodes already applied to the shape. Inserting the projection after the deformer leads to texture swimming during animation and is most often undesirable. C: Default is on.
        kir: (create) - True means keep any image ratio
        md: (create) - This flag specifies the mapping direction. 'x', 'y' and 'z' projects the map along the corresponding axis. 'c' projects along the current camera viewing direction. 'p' does perspective projection if current camera is perspective. 'b' projects along the best plane fitting the objects selected.
        n: (create) - Give a name to the resulting node.
        nds: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

    Use this command to split one or more vertices.  A mesh is made up
    of one or more faces.  The faces are defined by edges which connect vertices
    together.  Typically a face will share vertices and edges with adjacent
    faces in the same mesh.  Sharing vertices and edges helps reduce the amount
    of memory used by a mesh.  It also ensures that when a face is moved, all
    the connected faces move together.
    Sometimes you may want to separate a face from its connected faces so that
    it may be moved in isolation.  There are three ways to accomplish this depending
    upon which parts of the face you want to extract:
    
    
    polySplitVertex split one or more vertices so that each face that
    shared the vertex acquires its own copy of the vertex
    
    
    polySplitEdge split one or more edges so that each face that shared
    the vertex acquires its own copy of the edge
    
    
    polyChipOff completely extract the face so that it has its own vertices
    and edges
    
    
    
    Notice that the area of affect of each operation is different.  polySplitVertex
    will affect all the edges and faces that shared the vertex.  This is the broadest
    effect.  polySplitEdge will only affect the faces which shared the edge and polyChipOff
    will affect a specific face.  If we just count vertices to measure the effect of each
    command when splitting all components of a face, starting from a 3x3 plane which has 16
    vertices and we were to split the middle face:
    
    
    polySplitVertex applied to the four vertices would end up creating 12 new vertices
    
    
    polySplitEdge applied to the four edges would end up creating 4 new vertices
    
    
    polyChipOff applied to the middle face would end up creating 4 new vertices
    
    
    
    Note that polySplitVertex may create non-manifold geometry as a part of this operation.

The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

If construction history is on then the corresponding node will be inserted into the history chain for the mesh. If construction history is off then the operation will be performed directly on the object.  Note: If the object already has construction history then this flag is ignored and the node will always be inserted into the history chain.
        d: (create) - This flag specifies the number of subdivisions along the extrusion.
        ed: (create, multiuse) - This flag specifies the edgeId that should be used to perform the wedge about. Multiple edges can be specified. The wedge operation is performed about an axis that is the average of all the edges. It is recommended that only colinear edges are used, otherwise the result may not look intuitive.  Instead of specifying the -edge flag, the wedge can be performed about a point and axis. See the -center and -axis flags for details.

The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

    This command generates constant radius NURBS fillets and NURBS
    corner surfaces for matching edge pairs on NURBS surfaces.  An
    edge pair is a matching pair of surface isoparms or trim edges.
    This command
    can handle more than one edge pair at a time.
    This command can also handle compound edges, which is where an edge
    pair is composed of more than two surfaces.  Use the "-sa" and "-sb"
    flags in this case.
    
    The results from this command are three surface var groups plus the
    name of the new roundConstantRadius dependency node, if history was on.
    The 1st var group contains trimmed copies of the original surfaces.  The 2nd
    var group contains the new NURBS fillet surfaces.  The 3rd var group
    contains the new NURBS corners (if any).
    
    A simple example of an edge pair is an edge of a NURBS cube,
    where two faces of the cube meet.  This command generates a NURBS
    fillet at the edge and trims back the faces.
    
    Another example is a NURBS cylinder with a planar trim surface cap.
    This command will create a NURBS fillet where the cap meets the
    the cylinder and will trim back the cap and the cylinder.
    
    Another example involves all 12 edges of a NURBS cube.  NURBS fillets
    are created where any face meets another face.  NURBS corners are
    created whenever 3 edges meet at a corner.

    Args:
        a: (create) - If true, then an edge pair is being added to an existing round dependency node.  Default is false. When this flag is true, an existing round dependency node must be specified. See example below.
        ch: (create) - Turn the construction history on or off.
        n: (create) - Sets the name of the newly-created node. If it contains namespace path, the new node will be created under the specified namespace; if the namespace does not exist, it will be created.
        o: (create) - Create the result, or just the dependency node.
        rad: (create, multiuse) - Use this flag to specify radius.  This overrides the "r/radius" flag.  If only one "rad" flag is used, then it is applied to all edge pairs.  If more than one "rad" flag is used, then the number of "-rad" flags must equal the number of edge pairs.  For example, for four edge pairs, zero, one or four "rad" flags must be specified.
        s: (create, multiuse) - Use this flag for compound edges.  It replaces the sidea/sideb flags and is compatible with Python.  The first argument must be either "a" or "b".  The same number of "a" values as "b" values must be specified. If no sides are specified with the "side" flag (or sidea/sideb flags), then the edges are assumed to be in pairs. See also examples below. For example, two faces of a cube meet at an edge pair. Suppose one of the faces is then split in two pieces at the middle of the edge, so that there is one face on side "A", and two pieces on side "B".  In this case the flag combination: -side "a" 1 -side "b" 2 would be used. The edges must be specified in the corresponding order: // MEL roundConstantRadius -side "a" 1 -side "b" 2 isoA isoB1 isoB2; # Python maya.cmds.roundConstantRadius( 'isoA', 'isoB1', 'isoB2', side=[("a",1), ("b",2)] )

The same number of "-sa" flags as "-sb" flags must be specified. If no "-sa" nor "-sb" flags are specified, then the edges are assumed to be in pairs. See also examples below.

    r"""
    This command is used to show metadata values which is in the
    specified channels "vertex", "edge", "face", and "vertexFace" in
    the viewport. You can view the data by three ways:
    
    "color": draw color on the components. 
    "ray": draw a ray on the components. 
    "string": draw 2d strings on the components. 
    
    For example, if the metadata of "shape.vtx[1]" is (1, 0, 0), you can turn on
    the visualization with all three modes.
    On "color" mode, you can see a red vertex which is on the position of "shape.vtx[1]".
    On "ray" mode, you can see a ray with the direction (1, 0, 0).
    On "string" mode, you can see strings "1 0 0" below the vertex in the viewport.
    
    
    To use "color" or "ray" mode, you should make the member of the data structure
    with three or less items, such as float[3]. The three items are mapped to "RGB" as a color, or "XYZ"
    as a vector. The structure with two items works similarly. The only difference
    is that the third value will always be zero.
    However, if the structure has only one item, the value is mapped to all three variables.
    That means if the structure is "int" and its value is 1, the color will be white(1, 1, 1)
    and the vector will be (1, 1, 1).
    
    
    You can get the current status of the flags on the query mode (using "-query").
    But you can query only the status of one flag in a single command and
    you cannot set values on the query mode.
    
    
    You can use the command on some specified objects, or run it with no arguments
    to make changes on all objects in the scene. The object must be a mesh shape.
    Components are not allowed as the command arguments.

        a: (create, query) - Similar to the flag "-range", but uses the min/max value from the metadata in the same stream and member instead of the specified input value. In query mode, you can use the flag to query if "auto" is on.
        dt: (create, query) - In create mode, when used with the flags "stream" and "member", specify a member to show. If the flag "off" is used, specify the member to turn off. In query mode, when used with the flags "stream" and "member", query the visualization state of the specified member. Only one member of each shape can be visualized at a time. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        i: (create, query) - In create mode, enable/disable interpolation for "color" method. When interpolation is on, the components will be displayed in the interpolated color, which is computed by averaging their metadata values. In query mode, query the current state of interpolation flag of the selected objects.
        ia: (create, query) - Used to check if the given stream is activated. If some shapes are selected, query their states. If no shape is selected, query the states of all shapes in the scene.
        las: (create, query) - Used with object names to list all streams of the specified objects. no matter if they are visible in the viewport. Or you can use the flag individually to list all streams in the scene. Due to the fact that different objects may have the same stream name, the returned list will merge the duplicated stream names automatically.
        lm: (create, query) - Used with the flag 'stream' to get the member list in the specified stream.
        lvm: (create, query) - List the valid visual methods that can be set for the current stream and member. Some data type cannot be displayed by some methods. For example, if the data type is "string", it cannot be displayed by "color" or by "ray". In other words, only the method "string" will be returned when you list the methods.
        lvs: (create, query) - Used with object names to list the name of the current visible streams of the specified object. Or you can use the flag with no object name to list all visible streams in the scene.
        mb: (create, query) - In create mode, when used with the flags "stream" and "dataType", specify a member to show. If the flag "off" is on, specify the member to turn off. In query mode, when used with the flags "stream" and "dataType", query the visualization state of the specified member. Only one member of each shape can be visualized at a time. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        m: (create, query) - Determine the method of visualization: "color"         convert metadata to a color value and draw the components with the color "ray"           convert metadata to a vector and draw this vector line which starts from the center of the component "string"        display the metadata through 2d string beside the component in the viewport The argument must be a string and must be one of the three words. The default method is "color". If the data type is string, you can only show it with "string" method. In query mode, you can use the flag with no arguments to query the method of a specified stream and member.
        : (create, query) - In create mode, turn off the member which is specified by the flags "stream", "member" and "dataType".
        r: (create, query) - Specify the range of data to use. The value which is out of the range will be clamped to the min/max value. If the method of visualization is "color", the range will be mapped to the color. That means the min value will be displayed in black while the max value will be in white. In query mode, you can use the flag individually to query the current range.
        rs: (create, query) - Specify the scale of the ray to display it with a proper length.
        s: (create, query) - In create mode, when used with the flags "member" and "dataType", specify a member to show. If the flag "off" is used, specify the member to turn off. In query mode, when used with the flags "member" and "dataType", query the visualization state of the specified member. When used with the flag "listMembers", query the members in the specified stream. Only one member of each shape can be visualized at a time. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.

    This cmd creates a railed surface by sweeping the profile curve along
    the two rail curves. One of the requirements for surface creation is
    the profile curve must intersect the two rail curves. If the profile
    is a surface curve i.e. isoparm, curve on surface or trimmed edge then
    tangent continuity across the surface underlying the profile may be
    enabled using the flag -tp1 true.

Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.

    The smoothTangentSurface command smooths the surface along
    an isoparm at each parameter value.
    The name of the surface is returned and
    if history is on, the name of the resulting dependency node is
    also returned.
    This command only applies to parameter values with a multiple knot
    value.
    (If the given parameter value has no multiple knot associated
    with it, then the dependency node is created but the surface
    doesn't change.)
    
    When would you use this?  If you have a surface consisting of
    a number of Bezier patches or any isoparms with more than a single
    knot multiplicity, you could get into a situation where a
    tangent break occurs.  So, it only makes sense to do this operation
    on the knot isoparms, and not anywhere in between, because the
    surface is already smooth everywhere in between.
    
    If you have a cubic or higher degree surface, asking for the maximal
    smoothness will give you tangent, curvature, etc. up to the degree-1
    continuity.  Asking for tangent will just give you tangent continuity.
    
    It should be mentioned that this is "C", not "G" continuity we're
    talking about, so technically, you can still see visual tangent breaks
    if the surface is degenerate.

    The stitchSurface command aligns two surfaces together to be
    G(0) and/or G(1) continuous by ajusting only the Control Vertices
    of the surfaces. The two surfaces can be stitched by specifying
    the two isoparm boundary edges that are to stitched together. The
    edge to which the two surfaces are stitched together is obtained
    by doing a weighted average of the two edges. The weights for the
    two edges is specified using the flags -wt0, -wt1 respectively.

The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute.

It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.

For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy.

        nds: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

    Args:
        af: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node after the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        ar: (create, edit) - The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
        bf: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        clb: (create, edit) - Controls whether color borders are preserved when transferring color data. If this is non-zero, any color borders will be mapped onto the nearest edge on the target geometry. 0 means any color borders will be smoothly blended onto the vertices of the target geometry.
        cmp: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer
        dt: (query) - Returns the name of the deformer tool objects (if any) as string string ...
        ex: (create, query) - Puts the deformation set in a deform partition.
        fuv: (create, edit) - Controls how sampled UV data is flipped before being transferred to the target. 0 means no flipping; 1 means UV data is flipped in the U direction; 2 means UV data is flipped in the V direction; and 3 means it is flipped in both directions. In conjunction with mirroring, this allows the creation of symmetric UV mappings (e.g. the left hand side of the character on one side of the UV map, the right hand side on the other).
        foc: (create, edit) - This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        g: (edit, multiuse, query) - The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag returns string string string ...
        gi: (query) - Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each geometry.
        ignoreSelected: (create) - Tells the command to not deform objects on the current selection list
        ihs: (create) - Apply the deformer to any visible and hidden objects in the selection list. Default is false.
        mch: (create, edit) - When using topological component matching, selects between possible matches. If the meshes involved in the transfer operation have symmetries in their topologies, there may be more than one possible topological match. Maya scores the possible matches (by comparing the shapes of the meshes) and assigns them an index, starting at zero. Match zero, the default, is considered the best, but in the event that Maya chooses the wrong one, changing this value will allow the user to explore the other matches.
        n: (create) - Used to specify the name of the node being created.
        par: (create, edit) - Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        pr: (edit) - Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current configuration from the deformer set.
        rm: (edit, multiuse) - Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this deformer.
        spa: (create, edit) - Selects which space the attribute transfer is performed in. 0 is world space, 1 is model space, 4 is component-based, 5 is topology-based. The default is world space.

The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

The global optimization is much slower, but takes into consideration the entire object when optimizing uv placement.

The second function penalizes the first function by preventing configurations where triangles would overlap.

    This command will aid in the creation of non-overlapping regions (i.e. polygons)

    2) Relax all the internal texture UVs by performing a length minimization
    algorithm on all edges in texture space.

    Args:
        mb: (create) - Map the border containing the selected UV into a variety of shapes that may be more amenable to UV relaxation operations. There are various types of mapping available. All the resulting mappings are fit inside the unit square.

        r: (create) - Relax all UVs in the shell of the selected UV's. The relaxation is done by simulating a spring system where each UV edge is treated as a spring. There are a number of different methods characterized by the way the UV edges are weighted in the spring system. These weightings are determined by STRING. Valid values for STRING are: uniform - every edge is weighted the same. This is the fastest method. inverse_length - every edge weight is inversely proportional to it's world space length. inverse_sqrt_length - every edge weight is inversely proportional the the square root of it's world space length. harmonic - this weighting can yield near optimal results in matching the UV's with the geometry, but can also take a long time.
        rt: (create) - This sets the tolerance which is used to determine when the relaxation process can stop. Smaller tolerances yield better results but can take much longer.
